# Initial Setup for swarmlib

## Installation Steps
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install swarmlib:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade swarmlib
   ```
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   swarm --version
   ```

## Running Example Algorithms
To print all available algorithms in swarmlib, use the following command:
```bash
swarm --help
```

## Next Steps
- Explore each algorithm and their details in the [swarmlib wiki](https://github.com/HaaLeo/swarmlib/wiki)
- Implement selected algorithms to assess their impact on my learning and memory management capabilities.
